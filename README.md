# Tower-Defence-3D
TD 3D is a strategy based tower defence game playable on both mobile and PC. Players are challenged to carefully strategize and place specific towers according to the enemies they encounter. Players are rewarded according to their performance, with which they can purchase new tower upgrades and special items to help complete more difficult levels as they progress.

Work Process:
Tower defence 3D was developed on Unity 3D Engine with clean, modularized and reusable C# scripts with scriptable objects and object-oriented programming. Towers and enemies had various stats such as magic and physical damage, resistances to poison, burn or against a specific type of damage. Damage over time and area of effect damage were applied to some towers as well. Utilized binary serialization to securely save and load user game progress data. Optimized the game with data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient gameplay on the Web, PC and mobile devices.
